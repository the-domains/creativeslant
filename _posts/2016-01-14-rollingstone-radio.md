# RollingStone Radio

In working as Product Manager and Experience Lead way back in 2000 for RollingStone Radio, I managed all aspects of the development of the interactive media player. Responsibilities included the writing of all business, functional and design requirements, as well as setting project timeline, budget and client communications.

With this development we created the platform on which all of RadioWave's branded and terrestrial radio were based. Forty+ entertainment channels and ad services were accessed by over 2 million users per month.
