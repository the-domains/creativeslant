# About me.

Zachary Jean Paradis is a strategist, professor and author obsessed with transforming lives through experience innovation--he works at SapientNitro, teaches at IIT Institute of Design and lives in Chicago.

## Experience counts.

My background in design, business, social sciences, and technology has prepared me to help companies increase their hit rate of innovation. Design methods and integrative thinking can be used strategically, manifesting themselves in companies by creating organic growth through flexible process, an open culture, and more compelling, differentiated products and services.

Companies and clients with whom I have worked include:  
BMO, Fiat Chrysler Automotive, General Mills, Hyatt, John Deere, KBA Marketing, M&S, McDonald's, McLaren Automotive, Microsoft, Miller Brewing Company, P&G, RadioWave, Royal Bank of Scotland, RollingStone, SAP, Target, Unilever, United Health Group, Universal Music Group, Vodafone, Yahoo!, among others.

## Teaching next generation's innovators.

I continue to teach classes at the Illinois Institute of Technology at undergraduate and graduate levels. In the undergraduate program, I've created a course based on Naked Innovation which will be scaled to be taught to 500 students per semester: Entrepreneurship & New Ventures Innovation. At a graduate level, I teach at the IIT Institute of Design, specifically on the topics of Experience Modeling and Managing Complexity. In addition to formal classes, I've taught a variety of workshop and short form primers in customer experience and innovation across North America, Europe and India.

Undergrad degrees in Anthropology and Psychology from the University of Chicago got me focused on understanding people and a Masters of Design from the Illinois Institute of Technology's Institute of Design enabled me to better articulate how to turn that understanding into actionable strategies, offerings and innovation. I have also taken a sampling of courses at Bates College (psychology and theater) in Lewiston, Maine and at IIT's Stuart Graduate School of Business (operations management and organizational behavior).
